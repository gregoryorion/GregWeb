<p> "Super Freaky Girl" is a song by Trinidadian-born rapper and singer Nicki Minaj. It was released on August 12, 2022, by Young Money Entertainment and Republic Records as the lead single from Minaj's upcoming fifth studio album. An upbeat, raunchy song, it prominently samples Rick James's 1981 single "Super Freak", as Minaj raps about her sexual fantasies and endeavors, while also boasting about her career. It received comparisons to Minaj's 2014 single "Anaconda", as both tracks feature classic samples and sexual lyrics. -Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Freaky_Girl</p>
